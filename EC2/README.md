## 🌐 **Hosting a Simple Webpage**  

Here’s how you can host a basic `index.html` file on your EC2 instance.  

### Step 1: Install a Web Server  

Log into your EC2 instance via SSH and run the following commands to install a web server:  

```bash
# Update the package manager
sudo apt update  

# Install Apache2
sudo apt install apache2 -y  

# Start Apache2 service
sudo systemctl start apache2  

# Enable Apache2 to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable apache2  
```

### Step 2: Create Your Webpage  

Navigate to the default web server directory and create an `index.html` file:  

```bash
# Navigate to the default directory
cd /var/www/html  

# Create or edit the index.html file
sudo nano index.html  
```

Add the following content to your `index.html` file:  

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Welcome to My Webpage</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>🚀 Welcome to My First AWS EC2 Hosted Webpage!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple webpage hosted on an EC2 instance.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`).  

### Step 3: Open Your Webpage  

- In your browser, navigate to:  
  `http://<Public_IP_of_EC2_Instance>`  

You should see your `index.html` webpage live! 🎉  

---

## 🔒 **Security Best Practices**  

1. **Use Security Groups**: Restrict inbound traffic to only required ports.  
2. **Key Management**: Keep your `.pem` file secure.  
3. **IAM Roles**: Assign least privilege roles to your instances.  

---

## 🎉 **Conclusion**  

With this guide, you’ve:  
- Launched your first EC2 instance.  
- Installed a web server.  
- Hosted your first `index.html` webpage.  

Continue exploring AWS to enhance your cloud computing skills!
