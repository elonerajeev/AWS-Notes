   - Choose the Windows version and download the `.zip` file.

2. **Extract the downloaded zip**:
   - Extract the `.zip` file to a directory (e.g., `C:\Terraform`).

3. **Add Terraform to your system PATH**:
   - Open **Control Panel** > **System** > **Advanced system settings** > **Environment Variables**.
   - Under **System Variables**, find the **Path** variable, and click **Edit**.
   - Add the directory where you extracted Terraform (`C:\Terraform`).

4. **Verify installation**:
   - Open a **Command Prompt** and run:
     ```bash
     terraform --version
     ```
   - If Terraform is installed correctly, you will see the version number.

#### **For macOS** 🍏

## Steps to Configure and Run Terraform ⚙️

### 2. Create Your Terraform Configuration 🔄

1. **Create a working directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir terraform_project
   cd terraform_project
   ```

2. **Create a configuration file** (`main.tf`):
   - This file will define your infrastructure. For example, to create an AWS EC2 instance, use the following configuration:
   
   ```hcl
   ## COMPLETE CODE AVAILABLE INTO THE `main.tf` FILE 
   ```

   - Save the file as `main.tf`.

### 3. Initialize Terraform 🛠️

Run the following command in your terminal to initialize your Terraform working directory:
```bash
terraform init
```
This will download the necessary provider plugins (e.g., AWS) and initialize the working directory.

### 4. Validate the Configuration 🔍

Before applying the configuration, validate it with:
```bash
terraform validate
```

### 5. Plan the Execution 🔮

Run the following command to preview the changes Terraform will make:
```bash
terraform plan
```
Terraform will show you the resources it will create, update, or destroy.

### 6. Apply the Configuration 💼

To apply the configuration and create the resources:
```bash
terraform apply
```
Terraform will prompt you to confirm the action by typing `yes`.

### 7. Check Your Resources on AWS ✅

- Once Terraform finishes, log in to your **AWS Console**.
- Go to **EC2** > **Instances** to see your new EC2 instance running!

## Managing Infrastructure with Terraform 🔄

### 8. Destroy the Infrastructure 🛑

To destroy the resources created by Terraform, run:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
Terraform will prompt you for confirmation before destroying the resources.

## Troubleshooting 🔧

- **Terraform Command Not Found**:
  - Make sure you’ve added Terraform to your PATH.
  
- **Invalid AWS Credentials**:
  - If you encounter an issue with AWS credentials, you can configure them with the following command:
  ```bash
  aws configure
  ```

- **Permissions Issues**:
  - Ensure that your AWS IAM user has sufficient permissions to manage EC2 instances and other resources.
