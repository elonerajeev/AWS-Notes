# 🌍 **AWS CloudFront: Complete Guide** 🚀

## 🔥 **Introduction to AWS CloudFront**
AWS CloudFront is a **content delivery network (CDN)** service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to users globally **with low latency and high transfer speeds**. CloudFront caches content at **AWS edge locations** worldwide, reducing the load on the origin server and improving performance.

CloudFront integrates seamlessly with AWS services like **S3, EC2, Lambda@Edge, Route 53, API Gateway, WAF, and Shield**, making it a **powerful and secure** solution for content delivery.

---

## 🎯 **Key Features of AWS CloudFront**
✅ **Low Latency & High Performance** – Content is cached across 450+ globally distributed **edge locations**.  
✅ **Secure Content Delivery** – Supports **SSL/TLS encryption, AWS Shield, AWS WAF**, and **signed URLs**.  
✅ **Dynamic Content Acceleration** – Caches **static & dynamic content** efficiently.  
✅ **Customizable Content Delivery** – Supports **Lambda@Edge** for real-time content customization.  
✅ **Seamless Integration** – Works with **AWS S3, EC2, Load Balancers, Route 53, and more**.  
✅ **Cost-Effective** – Pay-as-you-go pricing with free tier options.

# 📘 **Understanding CDN Concepts**
Before diving into CloudFront, let’s understand the **key concepts**:

### 📍 **What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?**
A **CDN** is a network of **distributed servers** that cache content close to users, improving **website speed and reducing latency**. 

💡 **Example**:  
Imagine a website hosted in **New York, USA**. A visitor from **India** will experience slow loading times due to the long distance.  
With CloudFront, content is cached at an **edge location** in India, providing **faster access**.

---

## **🚀 How AWS CloudFront Works**
1️⃣ **User Requests Content**  
   - A user accesses `https://mywebsite.com/image.jpg`.  
   - DNS resolves it to the nearest **CloudFront edge location**.  

2️⃣ **Cache Lookup in Edge Location**  
   - If the content is already cached, it is delivered **instantly** (Cache Hit).  
   - If not cached, CloudFront fetches it from the **origin server** (Cache Miss).  

3️⃣ **Cache Storage and TTL (Time-to-Live)**  
   - CloudFront stores the content **temporarily** at the edge location.  
   - The **TTL** (configured in the distribution settings) determines how long content is cached.  

4️⃣ **Subsequent Requests**  
   - Future users near the **edge location** get **faster** access to the cached content.

# 🛠️ **Step-by-Step Guide to AWS CloudFront**

## **Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket with a Static Website**
We’ll host a simple **static website** using **Amazon S3** and serve it via **CloudFront**.

### **1️⃣ Create an S3 Bucket**
1. Go to **AWS Console → S3 → Create Bucket**.  
2. Enter **Bucket Name** (e.g., `my-cloudfront-bucket`).  
3. Uncheck **Block All Public Access** and confirm public access.  
4. Upload **index.html** and **other website files**.  
5. Enable **Static Website Hosting** in **Properties**.  
6. Copy the **S3 Endpoint URL** (`http://my-cloudfront-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`).

---

## **Step 2: Create a CloudFront Distribution**
A **CloudFront distribution** defines the **origin, cache behavior, and security settings**.

### **1️⃣ Open CloudFront in AWS Console**
1. Click **"Create Distribution"**.  
2. Under **Origin Settings**:  
   - **Origin Domain Name**: Select your **S3 bucket**.  
   - **Origin Protocol Policy**: Choose **HTTP Only** (for S3 static hosting).  
3. Under **Default Cache Behavior**:  
   - **Viewer Protocol Policy**: Redirect HTTP → HTTPS.  
   - **Allowed HTTP Methods**: Select **GET, HEAD** (for static content).  
   - **Cache Policy**: Use **Managed-CachingOptimized**.  
4. Under **Settings**:  
   - **Price Class**: Select **"Use Only U.S., Canada, and Europe"** (or **All Locations** for global access).  
   - **Custom SSL Certificate**: Use **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** to enable HTTPS.  
5. Click **Create Distribution**.  
6. Copy the **CloudFront Domain Name** (e.g., `d1234.cloudfront.net`).

---

## **Step 3: Configure DNS with Route 53**
1. Go to **Route 53 → Hosted Zones**.  
2. Select your domain (`mywebsite.com`).  
3. Click **"Create Record"** and choose:
   - **Record Type**: `CNAME`
   - **Name**: `www`
   - **Value**: `d1234.cloudfront.net`
4. Click **Create**.

Now, your website is accessible at **https://www.mywebsite.com** via CloudFront! 🎉

# 🚀 **Advanced CloudFront Features**

## **1️⃣ CloudFront with AWS Lambda@Edge**
💡 **Lambda@Edge** allows **custom logic at edge locations**.

### **Example: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**
1. Create an **AWS Lambda Function** (Node.js/Python).
2. Use this code to **redirect HTTP to HTTPS**:

```javascript
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const request = event.Records[0].cf.request;
    if (request.headers["cloudfront-forwarded-proto"][0].value !== "https") {
        return {
            status: "301",
            headers: {
                location: [{ key: "Location", value: `https://${request.headers.host[0].value}${request.uri}` }]
            }
        };
    }
    return request;
};
```

3. Attach the Lambda function to **CloudFront as an Origin Request Trigger**.

---

## **2️⃣ Restrict Access Using Signed URLs**
CloudFront allows **signed URLs** to restrict access to content.

### **Steps to Use Signed URLs**
1. **Generate CloudFront Key Pair** in the AWS console.
2. Create a **CloudFront distribution**.
3. Use **signed URLs** in applications to control access.

---

## **3️⃣ AWS WAF & Security Protection**
CloudFront **integrates with AWS WAF** to protect against **DDoS, SQL injection, and XSS attacks**.

### **Steps to Enable AWS WAF**
1. Go to **AWS WAF & Shield** in the AWS console.  
2. Create a **Web ACL** and attach it to **CloudFront**.  
3. Add rules to block malicious traffic.

# 🎯 **CloudFront Pricing**
AWS CloudFront pricing is based on:
- **Data Transfer Out** (cheaper than direct S3 requests).
- **HTTP/HTTPS Requests**.
- **Invalidation Requests** (to clear cache).
- **Lambda@Edge executions** (if used).

💡 **Tip**: CloudFront is **free for 1 TB of data transfer** in AWS Free Tier.
