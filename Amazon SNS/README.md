## **📖 Introduction to Amazon SNS**  
Amazon SNS is a **pub-sub messaging service** that allows applications to send messages to **multiple subscribers** (such as email, SMS, mobile devices, and HTTP/HTTPS endpoints).  

### **🔹 Why Use Amazon SNS?**
- Traditional messaging systems require polling or constant checking for updates, which increases **latency**.  
- SNS **pushes messages instantly** to multiple endpoints, improving **real-time communication**.  
- It provides a **scalable, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective** way to send notifications.

## **🔹 How Amazon SNS Works**  
Amazon SNS follows a **Publisher-Subscriber (Pub/Sub) Model**.  

### **1️⃣ Components of Amazon SNS**
| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **Topic** | A logical access point where messages are sent. |
| **Publisher** | The entity that sends messages to the topic. |
| **Subscriber** | The endpoint (Email, SMS, Lambda, HTTP) that receives messages. |
| **Message** | The actual content sent to the subscribers. |

### **2️⃣ Workflow of SNS**
1. A **Publisher** (EC2, Lambda, Application) sends a message to an SNS **Topic**.  
2. SNS **broadcasts** the message to all **Subscribers**.  
3. **Subscribers** receive messages via **Email, SMS, Lambda, SQS, HTTP, or Mobile Push Notifications**.  

✔ **Example Use Case:**  
When a new **user registers on a website**, an SNS topic can **trigger an email or SMS notification**.

    "StringEquals": {
      "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyLambdaRole"
    }
  }
}
```

### **2️⃣ Enable Encryption Using AWS KMS**
- Encrypt messages using **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** for **secure data transfer**.
