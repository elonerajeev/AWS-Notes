## 📘 **Types of EBS Volumes**  

AWS EBS provides several types of volumes tailored to different use cases:  

### 1. **General Purpose SSD (gp3, gp2)**  
- 💡 **Use Case**: Web servers, small databases.  
- **Key Features**: Balanced performance, cost-effective.  

### 2. **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2, io1)**  
- 💡 **Use Case**: High-performance databases, large-scale applications.  
- **Key Features**: High IOPS and durability.  

### 3. **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)**  
- 💡 **Use Case**: Big data, data warehouses, log processing.  
- **Key Features**: High throughput for sequential workloads.  

### 4. **Cold HDD (sc1)**  
- 💡 **Use Case**: Infrequently accessed data.  
- **Key Features**: Lowest-cost storage option.  

### 5. **Magnetic (Standard)** *(Deprecated)*  
- **Replaced by SSD and HDD options for better performance.*

## 🚀 **How EBS Works**  

1. **Attach to EC2**: EBS volumes are attached to EC2 instances.  
2. **Persistent Storage**: Unlike instance storage, EBS persists even after the instance stops.  
3. **Availability Zone (AZ)**: Volumes are specific to the AZ where they are created.  
4. **Snapshots**: Back up data to Amazon S3 using snapshots.  

---

## 🛠️ **Setting Up EBS**  

### Step 1: Create an EBS Volume  

1. Open the **AWS Management Console** and navigate to **EBS** under the EC2 Dashboard.  
2. Click **Create Volume**.  
3. Specify the **Type**, **Size**, and **Availability Zone**.  

### Step 2: Attach the Volume to an EC2 Instance  

1. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** and select your instance.  
2. Under **Storage**, click **Attach Volume**.  
3. Select the volume and attach it.  

### Step 3: Mount the Volume  

For a Linux EC2 instance, use the following steps:  

1. **List Block Devices**:  
   ```git
   lsblk
   ```  

2. **Create a Filesystem**:  
   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf
   ```  

3. **Mount the Volume**:  
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /data
   sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data
   ```  

4. **Verify Mounting**:  
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```  

5. **Persist Mounting**: Add the entry to `/etc/fstab` to mount automatically on reboot:  
   ```bash
   echo '/dev/xvdf /data ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
   ```

## 🔒 **Best Practices for Using EBS**  

1. **Use Snapshots**: Regularly back up data using EBS Snapshots.  
2. **Encrypt Data**: Enable encryption for sensitive workloads.  
3. **Monitor Performance**: Use **CloudWatch** to track IOPS and throughput.  
4. **Detach Unused Volumes**: Avoid costs by detaching and deleting unused volumes.  
5. **Optimize Costs**: Use volume types suited to your workload (e.g., gp3 for cost-effectiveness).

## 📘 **Example: Hosting a Website with EBS**  

Here’s a quick guide to host a simple HTML page using EBS:  

1. **Attach an EBS Volume** and mount it to the EC2 instance.  
2. **Install Apache**:  
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   sudo yum install httpd -y
   ```  

3. **Start the Web Server**:  
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start httpd
   ```  

4. **Host Your Page**:  
   Create an `index.html` file:  
   ```bash
   echo "<h1>Welcome to My AWS Website</h1>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
   ```  

5. **Access the Page**: Open the public IP of your EC2 instance in a browser.
